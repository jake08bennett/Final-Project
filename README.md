# Final-Project

Welcome to the animal quiz game. This game runs through Gosu and has 3 rounds for you to play in 60 seconds. I plan on adding multiple rounds in addition to the current ones in the near future.

#  How does it work?

The animal quiz works based off of 4 main classes. You have '''main.rb''' where everything included in the game is created, initialized, drawn and is updated. Next is '''options.rb''' which i specifically used in order to have 4 different answers that the user could select. '''timer.rb''' was used as it says in the name to create a timer for my game and finally '''round.rb''' was used to set up the rounds and check if the correct picture was shown when a certain option was pressed.
